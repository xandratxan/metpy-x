## What is MetPyX?

**MetPyX** is a collection of tools for x-ray metrology.
It is an open source, GPLv3-licensed library for the Python programming language.
It is compatible with Python 3.

## Main features of MetPyX

**MetPyX** provides two features:
- Manage **x-ray radiation qualities** and their corresponding **filtration thicknesses**.
- Manage **x-ray operational quantities** for radiation protection and their corresponding **irradiation angles**.

## How to install MetPyX?

**MetPyX** can be installed from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/metpyx/) 
by running the following command from a terminal:

```bash
pip install metpyx
```
